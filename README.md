# Binary-Tree-Integral-Calculator
This is an integral calculator in C++. It takes in a string of a polynomial, performs input validation and stores it in a binary search tree. Each node of the tree is a seperate term, and stored in ascending order. The tree is then parsed through and the integrated polynomial is returned, along with the solution if the input was a definite integral. 

This project features extensive use of C++ templates and pointers, and features edge case considerations and input validation.
